## Features

**Binary Serialization**: Converting *types* conforming to `HMBytesConvertable` to *bytes* and back. Out of the box support for basic Swift types like `String`, `Int`, `Double`, `URL` and more.

**Hex**: Converting between hex strings and bytes.


## Integration

It's **recommended** to use the library through *Swift Package Manager* (SPM), which is now also built-in to Xcode and accessible in `File > Swift Packages > ...` or  going to project settings and selecting `Swift Packages` in the top-center.  
When targeting a Swift package, the `Package.swift` file must include `.package(url: "https://github.com/highmobility/hmutilities-swift", .upToNextMinor(from: "[__version__]")),` under *dependencies*.
  

If SPM is not possible, the source can be downloaded directly from Github
and built into an `.xcframework` using an accompaning script: [XCFrameworkBuilder.sh](https://github.com/highmobility/hmutilities-swift/tree/master/Scripts/XCFrameworkBuilder.sh). The created package includes both the simulator and device binaries, which must then be dropped (linked) to the target Xcode project.

Furthermore, when `.xcframework` is also not suitable, the library can be made into a *fat binary* (`.framework`) by running [UniversalBuildScript.sh](https://github.com/highmobility/hmutilities-swift/tree/master/Scripts/UniversalBuildScript.sh). This combines both simulator and device slices into one binary, but requires the simulator slice to be removed *before* being able to upload to *App Store Connect* â€“ for this there is a [AppStoreCompatible.sh](https://github.com/highmobility/hmutilities-swift/tree/master/Scripts/AppStoreCompatible.sh) script included inside the created `.framework` folder.


## Requirements

HMUtilities Swift SDK requires Xcode 11.0 or later and is compatible with apps targeting iOS 10.0 or above.
